# Genome-Markov-Analysis
Contains code to perform first order hidden Markov analysis of nucleotide sequences

I plan to develop this to annotate gene sequneces. First I will focus on RNA and then move to (hopefully) full genome annotation. In the meantime, infrastructure exists for generic analysis. I plan to add documentation pending my availability. Please have fun with this!
